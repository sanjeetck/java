Write a program that:
•	Prints on System.out the line 'Application Started', and then starts ten threads.
•	Each thread should print a line saying 'Thread x started' where x is the thread's index (0-9), and then print 'Thread x finished'. 
•	All start messages must be printed before the first finish message. 
•	After the thread has printed its finish message it should terminate. 
•	After all finish messages have been printed the main thread should print 'Application Finish' and terminate. 
•	The order in which the thread messages are printed should not be predictable from a review of the code and should be different on each running of the application. 

Tips:
•	Use of the java.util.concurrent package is encouraged—you’re free to write your own utility class, but it’s probably faster to do some research on this package instead. 
•	Simpler is better. We’re not looking for number of lines of code, but simplicity and correctness.
•	No need to send us the whole Eclipse project, etc. This can all fit into one .java file.
