Write a program where there are 10 Producer threads & 10 consumer threads.

Producer thread put data in an Array of size 10 & can only insert data if Array is not already full.
Consumer thread take data from this array in FIFO format & delete that data from array so that no other thread can take what they had read.

If Producer wants to insert data & Array is full it should block.
If Consumer wants to pick data & Array in empty that should block.

As the data becomes available blocked consumers should start working. 
As new blank cell is available in Array blocked Producers should start putting data. 

After picking data from Array a Consumer should sleep for some random time < 5 sec.
After inserting data into Array Producer should sleep for some random time < 5 sec.

Test this collection with two scenarios 
1	Producers are two times faster than consumers.
2	Consumers are two times faster than Producer.

Pl. do not use any collection from java.util.concurrent package.
